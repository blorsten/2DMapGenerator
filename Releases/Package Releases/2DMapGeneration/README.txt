Hello, thank you for using our World Builder 2D.
To get started follow these few simple steps.

Importing of the asset:
1.  Locate the Unity package file packed with this file.
2.  Import the package file into your current Unity project.
3.  (OPTIONAL) If you dont want to use the demo we've made, exclude it from importation.

Chunk Setup:
1. Before you can generate a map you need some chunks, go to your gameobject hierarchy window.
2. Hit create and find the chunk button under 2DMapGeneration.
3. Change the settings on the newly create game objects Chunk component.
4. If you want the new chunk to match a specific blueprint change its size accordingly.
5. If you know how to use Unity's tilemap editor continue, if not Google it.
6. Use the tilemap editor to design your chunk.
7. Use the custom brushes to make dynamic openings or flagged tiles.
8. If your chunk doesn't have any dynamic openings, set the manually on the chunk component.

Algorithm Setup:
1. To create some new algorithms go to the asset window and hit create.
2. Find our 2D Map Generation tab and select a desired algorithm.
3. Give it a name, and if it has any parameters change them to your liking.

Blueprint Setup:
1.  Head over to your assets window and add a new blueprint, give it a name.
2.  If you've made any algorithms add them to your newly made blueprint.  

Map Builder Setup:
1.  Create a scene with a new game object.
2.  Add the 'MapBuilder' component to the newly made game object.
3.  If you've made a blueprint add it to the map builder.
